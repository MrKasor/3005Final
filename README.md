# 3005Final

The Q2 Directory holds the Java JDBC UI Implimentation for the Database.
I could for some reason not get it working in VSCode so I had to use IntelliJ .
The .jar postgres file was required to get the jdbc working in IntelliJ.

This youtube video shows you how easily.

The SQL Folder has part 1 and part 2 of my SQL Querys to make the Database.
Run FinalDBP1.sql first then FinalDBP2.sql second.

In postgres I named the Database 'BookStore' with a password of 'beaubeau' and used the default user of 'postgres'
the default port is '5432'
All of this is at the top of the Test.java file that is in the Q2 directory which holds the UI

That is everything you need to know for running it.
The UI Java file has 1264 lines of code alone but this course is my first time using databases.
This whole project was very vague and took me over a 100 hours to complete so I hope it doesn't burn your eyes.
